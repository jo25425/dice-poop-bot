# dice-poop-bot
*It's a dice. It's a poop. It's a BOT!!*

Let's make a bot for our Discord server. And get coding together while at it.

This is a [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) project.
To get going, you'll just need to create a `config.json` from the `config_template.json` and add the required tokens for 
your version of the bot.
